# SVAR_tools
SVAR toolbox for bayesian VAR estimation and a range of identification methods

VAR toolbox that allows a bayesian estimation of the VAR coefficients with changeable priors (edit in BVAR in "Functions" folder). Allows three identifications: The long-run restriction of Blanchard & Quah 1989/Gali 1999, the Max Share approach of Francis et. al. 2014 and a standard Cholesky identification.
The bayesian VAR function outputs IRFs, FEVDs, historical decompositions, and structural shock series. A full example is provided, estimating VARs consisting of labor productivity, employment, investment and consumption as a share of GDP, inflation, and long-term bond yields.

Further identifications will be provided in due course, including spectral and limited spectral identifications. Futher information available in: "The Identification of Dominant Macroeconomic Drivers: Coping with Confounding Shocks", available at genekindberg.github.io/Research
